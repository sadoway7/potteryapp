<p>This app is a progressive web app that feels native on mobile devices while remaining accessible on desktop for detailed analysis and reporting.</p>
<p>The main goal is tracking markets - and making a database or markets when where, details. so other users can find those markets - people should be able to add private markets - but adding a market should be public by default and check against existing markets to prevent duplicates.</p>
<p>Users will be adding a market so they can track their things - they have an option to keep it private - theyre personal details - or things they need to track should always be private - but the market details can be public - so that other users can use that market template - the market template should include details about the market - like email, size. esimated turnout, vendor thumbs up or thumbs down if they like it so the markets can be ranked.</p>

<h3>Key Design Questions to Address</h3>
<p>How can we make sale entry so fast that vendors won't skip logging transactions during busy periods?</p>
<p>What's the minimum viable data set needed to provide meaningful insights?</p>
<p>How do we balance feature richness with app simplicity for users who may not be tech-savvy?</p>
<p>What offline capabilities are absolutely essential vs. nice-to-have?</p>
<p>How can we gamify or incentivize consistent data entry?</p>
<h3>Success Criteria</h3>
<p>The app should enable vendors to:</p>
<p>Reduce time spent on administrative tasks by 50%</p>
<p>Increase average profit margins through better market selection and inventory management</p>
<p>Make data-driven decisions about market participation</p>
<p>Spend more time on their craft and customer relationships, less on paperwork</p>
<p>Build this as a progressive web app that feels native on mobile devices while remaining accessible on desktop for detailed analysis and reporting.</p>
<p>i will be hosting this webapp on my domain rumfor.com -</p>
<p>i will be using gitpul ti get updates installed as we make changes</p>
<p>i will be using namecheap shared hosting - so we need to make sure we are not using resources that require a vm or private docker container</p>
<p>the markets that end up in the database - will get their own page - we may end up adding more features even down the road too</p>
<p>anyone can create a new market profile - we need to make the rating system non agressive - we dont want to bomb markets - we just want to know whats going on - some markets are better for different vendors - so maybe trying to have positive up for what the market is good for, instead of negativs</p>
<p>the market discovery and search sounds about right.</p>
<p>in the personal market management - they user will be able to click into their markets - and each of their markets will be configurable with variouse things they can track - and get reminds etc - this is almost like a mini app on top - but not seperate - just has be be detailed.</p>
<p>event logginc and calander yes</p>
<p>yes to all of it you seem to understand</p>
<p>i will be hosting this webapp on my domain rumfor.com -</p>
<p>i will be using gitpul ti get updates installed as we make changes</p>
<p>i will be using namecheap shared hosting - so we need to make sure we are not using resources that require a vm or private docker container</p>
<p>we also need to make a good plan md, todo - really think about structure and how this app is factored so we dont need to refactor too much. we will need to make sure we have the neccesary branches and file handlers to make surewe can add new features as need, it needs to be broken up more than we probably thing in the start - lots of files doing little tasks - so that we can keep track. and we also need a master file stucture that gets updated and has notes to requires updates from anyone that sees it. so that we can keep track of what files are doing what and passing teh data around</p>
<p>and we also need to have a good database that will be expandable - without breaking or getting bogged own - there may be some logical real world example of database templates we can learn from</p>
<p>when we get this app going - i will be pulling from the github and live testing it - i will do git pulls</p>
<p>the domain we are going to be ussing is rumfor.com or www.rumfor.com or any regular way of typing the rumfor.com url -</p>
<p>i also can giv eyou the database details</p>
<p>xsoucsnq_tracker</p>
<p>xsoucsnq_trackeruser</p>
<p>Oswald1986!</p>
<p>i think we will use postgreSQL</p>
<p>User: xsoucsnq_rumforuser</p>
<p>Database: xsoucsnq_rumfor</p>
<p>password: Oswald1986!</p>
<p>they will not user it to track inventory - but they can track sales - or costs related to the market like vendor fees -they should be able to decide what they track per market.</p>
<p>the main goal is tracking markets - and making a database or markets when where, details. so other users can find those markets - people should be able to add private markets - but adding a market should be public by default and check against existing markets to prevent duplicates.</p>
<p>useres will be adding a market so they can track their things - they have an option to keep it private - theyre personal details - or things they need to track should always be private - but the market details can be public - so that other users can use that market template - the market template should include details about the market - like email, size. esimated turnout, vendor thumbs up or thumbs down if they like it so the markets can be ranked</p>
<p>there needs to be status for the markets a user adds - like "pending application" "pending approvbal" "pending payment" "approved" - the user will update this as they get more information as they process their work and get their things done and need to update so they know where they are at</p>
<p>the user should have their own personal calendar. once they have added the market - it will show up in their personal list with the status - they can add or remove it - in that market they can do all their planning privatly. but still be able to add comments to the public market listing</p>
<p>they can have private notes - but they there can be public notes or message board for the market also -</p>
<p>duplicates should cross check against multiple atributes to find at least 2 matching stats- so that the user can be warned before they add a duplicate.</p>
<p>vendor profiles will be fairly minimal on the public side - privatly vendors can see all their info and add friends. but publicly it will just show markets the vendor has attended - this will be when a vendor changes the status of one of there markets to completed.</p>
<p>markets should always be able to be commented on once made - there should be a tab just to see the markets going on and find ones around you. or different searching, almost like how grindr or the location dating apps work. but we wont use real gps, people can pin on a map where the market is. we dont use map api.</p>
<p>there should also be a my markets - the ones you have copied. or i guess made if it didnt exist yet.</p>
<p>but sometimes vendors may want to talk while they are preparing for the market - so each market should havea messabe board -</p>
<p>the application status - is m ore like the users status with the market - the user can use default status - or type in their own if they want - but there will be some status that are always required - like interested, application sent, approved. and complete - because some of those status may matter how the user shows in the app</p>
<p>if the user sets the status to approved - they will show on the market as an attending vendor - for example</p>
<p>the database can be used when deploying - once we get it working i can report things when we push updates - for now we just need to start the projet and get the bassline setup -</p>
