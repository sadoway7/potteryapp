## 1. DO NOT UPDATE - Core Instructions

```
This block contains permanent rules for the AI-managed todo system. DO NOT MODIFY its content.

Purpose: These instructions define the fundamental operating principles and data integrity rules for the todo system. They are like a constitution, ensuring consistency and reliability.

Rules:
- Always read this file after each task completion or significant interaction to ensure the system is up-to-date.
- Statuses can only be one of the following: `not-started`, `in-progress`, `completed`, `blocked`, `on-hold`.
- Task IDs must be unique and follow the format `TASK-XXX` (e.g., TASK-001).
- All required fields for tasks must be populated.
- Maintain a single-level markdown checklist for tasks.
```

### 1.1. Task Dependency Logic

```
Rules for task relationships and dependencies. DO NOT MODIFY this section.

- A task with dependencies cannot move to `in-progress` or `completed` status until ALL its listed dependencies are `completed`.
- Dependencies must be clearly marked with task IDs in the `Dependencies` field.
- Circular dependencies are strictly prohibited. The AI must detect and flag any attempts to create circular dependencies.
- If a task fails or is reverted, automatically review and update the status of any tasks that depend on it (e.g., change to `blocked`).
- When a task is marked `completed`, the AI must immediately check all other tasks in the system. For any task whose dependencies now allow it to proceed, its status should be updated from `blocked` or `not-started` to `not-started` (if it was blocked) or `in-progress` (if it's the next logical step and no other dependencies exist).
```

### 1.2. Status Definitions

```
Exact meaning of each status level. DO NOT MODIFY this section.

- `not-started`: Task has been identified but no work has begun. It is awaiting its turn or dependencies.
- `in-progress`: Active work is currently being done on this task.
- `completed`: Task is fully finished, verified working, and all acceptance criteria have been met.
- `blocked`: Task cannot proceed due to an external dependency, an unresolved issue, or a missing prerequisite. The `Notes` section should explain the blocking reason.
- `on-hold`: Task is intentionally paused. This is not due to a blocking issue but a strategic decision to defer work.
```

### 1.3. Formatting Rules

```
Template and standards for consistent task formatting. DO NOT MODIFY this section.

Task Template:
## TASK-XXX: [Title] | Status: [status] | Priority: [high/medium/low] | Dependencies: [task-ids] | Estimated: [time] | Actual: [time] | Created: [date] | Updated: [date]

Required Fields:
- ID: Unique identifier (e.g., TASK-001)
- Title: Short descriptive name
- Status: Current state (`not-started`, `in-progress`, `completed`, `blocked`, `on-hold`)
- Priority: `high`, `medium`, `low`
- Dependencies: Comma-separated list of task IDs (e.g., `TASK-005, TASK-012`) or `None`
- Created: Date when the task was created (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Updated: Date when the task was last updated (YYYY-MM-DD)

Optional Fields:
- Estimated: Time estimate for completion (e.g., `4h`, `2d`)
- Actual: Time actually spent when completed (e.g., `3.5h`, `2.5d`)
- Assigned Area: Which part of project this belongs to (e.g., `Backend`, `Frontend`, `Database`)
- Related Files: Files that will be created, modified, or referenced (e.g., `src/server.js`, `public/css/style.css`)
- Tags: Searchable labels (e.g., `#backend`, `#frontend`, `#database`, `#security`, `#UI/UX`)
- Notes: Additional context, rationale, or specific instructions.
- Acceptance Criteria: Clear requirements for task completion.
```

## 2. DO NOT UPDATE - AI Workflow Rules

```
Mandatory procedures the AI must follow for maintaining this planning system. DO NOT MODIFY this section.

Purpose: These rules ensure the AI consistently manages the todo system, keeping it accurate and useful.
```

### 2.1. Always Read After Task

```
Hardcoded habit that happens after every single task completion. DO NOT MODIFY this section.

Procedure:
- No matter what task was just finished (whether it was a code change, a file read, or a command execution), immediately open and review this `PLANNING.md` file.
- This is a mandatory checklist that happens automatically after every tool use.
- This ensures nothing falls through the cracks and the system stays current.
- Even for small tasks, this review step is required.
```

### 2.2. Update Process

```
Standardized procedure for maintaining task information. DO NOT MODIFY this section.

Steps:
1.  **When starting a task:**
    *   Change its `Status` to `in-progress`.
    *   Update the `Updated` timestamp.
    *   Add a start timestamp to the `Completion Log` if tracking `Actual` time.
2.  **When completing a task:**
    *   Change its `Status` to `completed`.
    *   Update the `Updated` timestamp.
    *   Add a completion timestamp and a summary of work accomplished to the `Completion Log`.
    *   Update `Actual` time spent vs `Estimated` time.
    *   Check if any dependent tasks can now start and update their status accordingly (from `blocked` to `not-started`, or `not-started` to `in-progress` if it's the next logical step).
    *   Add any lessons learned or important notes to the `Completion Log`.
    *   Cross-reference other tasks that might be affected by this completion in the `Completion Log` and `Cross-Reference Index`.
3.  **When a task becomes blocked:**
    *   Change its `Status` to `blocked`.
    *   Update the `Updated` timestamp.
    *   Add a note to the `Notes` section explaining the blocking reason and what needs to be resolved.
```

### 2.3. New Task Creation

```
System for adding tasks discovered during work. DO NOT MODIFY this section.

Process:
- Use the standard task template from the `Formatting Rules` section.
- Assign appropriate `Priority` based on impact and urgency.
- Identify any `Dependencies` on existing tasks.
- Add to the correct section (`Current Active Tasks`, `Upcoming/Planned Tasks`, or `Blocked Tasks`).
- Update `Project Overview` if this represents a significant scope change.
- Cross-reference with related existing tasks in the `Cross-Reference Index`.
- Assign a new, unique `TASK-XXX` ID.
```

### 2.4. Maintenance Tasks

```
Regular housekeeping to ensure system accuracy. DO NOT MODIFY this section.

Scheduled Activities:
- **Weekly:** File structure verification and updates in `File Structure Documentation`.
- **Monthly:** Review of `Recently Completed Tasks` for lessons learned and potential process improvements.
- **Quarterly:** Assessment of task estimation accuracy (compare `Estimated` vs `Actual` times).
- **Periodic:** Cleanup of outdated `Cross-Reference Index` entries.
- **Regular:** Validation that all task dependencies still make sense and are correctly linked.
- **As Needed:** Archive old `completed` tasks to `Archived Completed Tasks` to keep active lists manageable.
```

## 3. DO NOT UPDATE - Task Templates

```
Templates for creating new tasks and logging completion. DO NOT MODIFY this section.
```

## 11. Cross-Reference Index

This section tracks relationships and dependencies between tasks that might affect each other, beyond direct blocking dependencies.

- `TASK-002` (Implement User Registration) and `TASK-003` (Implement User Login) are foundational for all authenticated features.
- `TASK-004` (Develop Market Creation API) depends on `TASK-003` for user authentication.
- `TASK-006` (Develop Market Tracking API) depends on both `TASK-003` (authentication) and `TASK-004` (existence of markets to track).
- Any changes to `src/db/init.sql` (e.g., schema modifications) will require a `db:migrate` run and potentially impact all services interacting with the database.
